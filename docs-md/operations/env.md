## Environment Variables

Other than the interactions environment variables can have on configuration,
there are several standard environment variables that effect the operation of
any libmtev application.

 * ##### EVENTER_DEBUGGING

   If set to 1 it will enable the `debug/eventer` log stream.

 * ##### MTEV_JIT_OFF

   If set to 1 it will disable the JIT within the lua module.

 * ##### MTEV_JIT_OPT

   If numeric and positive, it be passed numerically to `jit.opt.start` in
   the lua module.

 * ##### MTEV_RDTSC_REQUIRE_INVARIANT

   If set to 0, this will disable the requirement for an invariant rdtsc
   for libmtev's "faster time" support.

 * ##### MTEV_RDTSC_DISABLE

   If set to 1, this will disable libmtev's "faster time" support.

 * ##### MTEV_THREAD_BINDING_DISABLE

   If set to 1, threads created via `mtev_thread` will not be bound to CPUs.

 * ##### MTEV_DIAGNOSE_CRASH

   If set to 0 or non-numeric, libmtev's internal crash handling code will not
   be run.

 * ##### MTEV_LOG_DEBUG

   If numeric and non-zero, this turns on debug logging for the logging system.
   This should only be used by developers to debug the logging system itself.
   These logs all go to stderr.

 * ##### MTEV_ASYNCH_CORE_DUMP

   If zero, this disables "asynch core dumps."  It forces the monitor process
   to wait for the child process to leave the process table before attempting
   to restart it upon crash.

 * ##### MTEV_ALTSTACK_SIZE

   A size (in bytes) for the altstack for handling crashes.

 * ##### MTEV_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT

   A timeout observed by the parent monitor.  If the child process
   does not heartbeat from each thread within this number of seconds,
   the monitor will terminate and restart the child.  Non-integral
   numbers are allowed.
